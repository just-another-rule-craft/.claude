- Use pattern matching in function heads for different scenarios
- Always validate user input and sanitize data
- Follow the Phoenix naming conventions for modules and functions
- Use Phoenix generators when appropriate for consistency
- Implement comprehensive tests for all business logic
- Use `Phoenix.Component` for reusable UI components
- Follow the controller → context → schema flow for data operations
